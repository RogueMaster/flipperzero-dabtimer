# Dab Timer / Clock (By RogueMaster)
- We were the first clock created for Flipper Zero
- Has 10 different clock faces
- - Includes a circular clock face
- - Includes a BINARY clock & timer
- - Faces can be changed using the left button
- Start/Stop timer using center button
- Built in timer chime after 80 seconds (1 minute and 20 seconds)
- - This timer preset length can be changed using up and down buttons
- - Timer sound can be changed by pressing right button when timer is running.
- Timer chime options:
- - `S:Mario` - Super Mario Theme chime at timer preset and minute chime enabled.
- - `S:ByMin` - Minute chime only.
- - `S:OFF` - No chimes enabled.
- - `S:PoRa` - Power Rangers Theme chime at timer preset and minute chime enabled.
- - `S:Cont` - Repeat chime each minute after the timer preset.
- Uses system time format settings

## Controls

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Left before starting a timer | Cycle all ten faces: Pwn, Original, Original Small, Circle, Binary, then their inverted variants. |
| Left after a timer has started | Reset elapsed time while keeping the current running/paused state. |
| Hold Left | Stop and fully reset the timer, enabling face selection again. |
| OK | Start, pause, or resume; ordinary timer toggling remains disabled while Game Mode is active. |
| Up/Down while running | Adjust the preset in five-second steps, with no underflow or overflow. |
| Right | Cycle OFF, ByMin, Mario, PoRa, and Cont; sequence-prefix keys retain their special handling. |
| Back from an idle code state | First press clears the Easter egg and arms exit; the second press exits. |
| Hold Back | Exit directly. |

The sequence **Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right** retains the Game
Mode toggle and animated Easter egg. Continuing with **Back, OK** forces Game
Mode off, saves the setting, and retains success/rainbow/XP feedback.
